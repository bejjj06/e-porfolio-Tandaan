Introduce yourself as a reader and learner in Great Books.
-About Me as a Reader and Learner

Hello and welcome to my e-Portfolio. My name is Jet Ace M. Tandaan, and I am a student who enjoys reading and discovering new ideas through literature. In Great Books, I learned to look at stories with more attention and to think about how they connect to real life. I read with curiosity and to understand how writers share their messages and how they evoke messages to readers. 

Briefly explain what the course is about.

-About the Course

Great Books is a course that focuses on important works of literature from different times and places. Throughout the course, we read several texts and discussed their themes, characters, and deeper meanings. We used different lenses to rationally analyze the different stories. We practiced how to think critically, how to support our ideas with evidence, and how to appreciate the value of literature in understanding human experiences and how they affect beliefs, practices, and culture. 

State the purpose of the website (portfolio of literary analyses).
Mention the critical lenses we studied (e.g., Formalist, Feminist, Marxist, Psychoanalytic,
Archetypal, Reader-Response, etc.).
Purpose of This Website

The purpose of this website is to present my portfolio of different literary analyses from the Great Books course. It includes the essays and analysis I wrote while studying the subject. My goal is to show how my reading skills and interpretations have developed over time. This portfolio highlights my work and demonstrates what I learned from each piece of literature. This portfolio also includes my whole understanding and knowledge I gained through studying the subject.



2. Six (6) Literary Analyses
Analyze six stories we tackled in class.
Each analysis must:
Identify the critical lens used
Include a short summary of the text
Present a well-developed interpretation/argument
Each analysis should be placed on a separate webpage or section, clearly labeled.

Archetypal 
Job 38 and Psalm 23 
Job chapter 38 in the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible begins with God speaking to Job out of a whirlwind, challenging Job's understanding of creation and the natural world. It recounts God's questions to Job about the foundations of the earth, the boundaries of the sea, the dawn, the gates of death, the source of light and darkness, the treasures of snow and hail, the paths of lightning, and the sustenance of rain and ice. The chapter emphasizes God's omnipotence and Job's limited knowledge in comparison to the Creator.

Psalm 23 describes the Lord as a caring shepherd who provides, protects, and guides his people, assuring them of His constant presence and ultimate eternal dwelling with Him.

Reader Response
Panchatantra

Panchatantra teach moral lessons in imaginative and straightforward narratives, but
certain stories have a meaning that stays with you even after you finish reading them. "The
Lioness and the Young Jackal" is one of those stories. At first, it appears to be merely a fable of
animal behavior, but it addresses profound human emotions, including feelings of acceptance,
love, and rejection. I read the story and I was not just receiving the true message, but also
connecting with its deeper truths on a personal matter. Through the story, we learn that even
though we are from in different walks of life, around our family, our friends, or around people
who love us, we still show our own purpose, our own belief, and our own practices. I learn from
the story that we should not judge anyone and not everyone has the same faith. However, we can come together for what is good and right. It brought back memories of times in my life when  I was trying to fit into groups of people, when I did not feel like everybody else, and when I had to choose whether to act like everybody else or simply be myself.

The story revolves around a lioness and her lion cubs, who raise a young jackal as their
own. Out of sympathy, the lion brings the jackal home, and the lioness agrees to adopt him. For
some time, the jackal is embraced as a part of the family. He sleeps, he eats, and he plays with
the lion cubs and feels he's among them. But as the years pass by, the differences are more
notable, especially when courage and instincts come to be tested. When the wild elephant
appears and the lion cubs hold firm courageously, the jackal runs away in fright. His reaction
causes the cubs to tease him, and the lioness finally tells him the harsh reality, that he never was one of them, and never was. She sends him packing, forcing him to leave the only home he had ever known, that he never imagined the people will hurt him by telling the truth.

What really impact with me was the lessons to which I identified with the jackal.
Growing up, there were times when I felt that I was trying to live up to others' expectations or
become part of groups that did not quite get me. Whether with peers, family members, or even
some school settings, I usually felt pressured to change parts of myself in order to fit in. One of
my actual experiences was when I began college and, being a stranger at a private school like
UNC, was frightened and didn't belong. But reading this Story helped me to realize when the
time being new and feeling afraid, like the jackal, was okay in the right place. I came in good
connection with the right group of friends who supported and helped me pursue my dreams and
goals in life. Just like the jackal, I never always had a notion of why I was special. I just knew I
was. And just like him, I sometimes tried to prove to others that I was equal, even though it
seemed others had already judged me. The jackal's rage, his hurt pride, and his eventual
realization that he didn't belong felt real. It was bringing back memories of the emotional
experince of always trying to prove yourself deserving in a place that isn't created for you, where
people don't see the good that you see, but your flaws.

But, like the lion's courage, there is a different side of the jackal that I want to point out,
being unique is a special identity. It's something not everyone has, and it makes us stand out in
special ways. My actions are my voice. They speaks who I am. I don't need to prove myself with
words when my work can speak and say I can be capable, strong, and best in special way..
I loved the fact that the story doesn't show any character as fully good or bad. I also
sympathized with the lioness. Removing the jackal was hurting, even heart-breaking, but it
wasn't from cruelty. She understood that however much she loved the jackal, it would never be as different from her cubs as to ever be a substitute. It made me remember that love sometimes has limitations when identity and belongingness conflict. Genuine love requires much understanding,patience, and trust, and at times even sacrifice.

The more I read, the change in my initial impression of the story grew stronger. I
originally thought that the fable was about pride or stepping beyond one's limits. But further in, I
recognized that it was really about the battle between who we are and where we try to fit in. It
made me reflect on moments of my life where I tried to hold on to relationships, groups, or
identities that did not define me. The ending,where the jackal leaves and encounters his own clan was somber but freeing. There is pain in leaving a home you once knew, but there is strength in finding out where you belong, even if it's hard. It gave me a better insight that love and acceptance are tested through sacrifice and challenges. Like the jackal, we all deserve a space that is homely.

The fable left me rather contemplative and sentimental. It reminded me that forcing
oneself to be accepted creates emotional wounds, and that at times the greatest love for oneself is to be who you are, even if the rest of the world cannot handle it. It made me question how we
treat the people who are different from us. Do we love them unconditionally, or conditionally?
This question made me reflect upon and made me appreciate my own worth. My authenticity,
empathy, and ability to accept people for what they are impacted my understanding of this fable.
I did not consider the jackal weak or unappreciative. I looked at someone who just wished to be
loved for himself.

Although some might think the moral of the story is to stay in your place, what I saw was
something else. To me, it is not about being happy where you are, it's about growing. The story
taught me that even in places where there is love, if who you really are is not accepted, you will
have to settle for being accepted or real. That is not pride, it's reality. And it is something that
needs to be heard by others.

In the end, "The Lioness and the Young Jackal" left a mark on me. It reminded me that
home is not just where one is taken care of by people, but where one is seen by them. Being
expelled may be rejection, but it may be the beginning of something better. This story, even
being old, has a message that is still strong today. It is a reminder to us to ask: Who am I? Where do I belong? And do I rather just walk away from love that requests I be anyone except for myself? It reminds young generation to think critically and be open-minded. It is a fable of our lives. And it is a reminder that, in the end, we can create our own story.

Feminist
Cupid and Psyche

Feminist criticism is an approach that helps uncover how gender shapes the way stories are
told. It looks at who gets to be the protagonist, how women are portrayed, and what roles they are given in literature. Feminist criticism questions how stories reflect, support, or challenge systems that often place men in positions of power while limiting what women can do. Myths like Cupid and Psyche offer more than tales of love and Gods, they reflect deeper messages about gender, power, and the changing image of women over the time.

In Cupid and Psyche, symbolism plays a key role in uncovering cultural truths. These
symbols are not just elements or decorations. They hold meaning that help to signify message. Thelamp represents the light of truth and feminine curiosity. The butterfly reflects the soul of Psyche, showing her inner transformation and true beauty. The scale symbolizes justice and equality. These are the same elements I used in my digital poster to show that symbols are not just for design, they carry values tied to culture and personal growth. They remind us that story can hold truths that still speak to us today.

Looking at the story through a feminist lens, Cupid and Psyche becomes more than a
romantic fairytale. Psyche is a mortal woman admired for her beauty and charm, but also punished for it. The goddess Venus, jealous of Psyche’s growing fame, sends her son Cupid to ruin her. Instead, Cupid falls in love with her. What follows is a journey filled with challenges, separation, pain, and a deeper understanding of love.

At the beginning of the story, Psyche fits the traditional idea of a passive woman. She is
praised for her beauty but has little control over her life. Her destiny is decided by others, by Venus, Cupid, and even her own family. Her beauty becomes both a blessing and a curse. She is worshipped, yet deeply alone. Venus punishes her not for anything she did, but for being admired, that she exceeded Venus beauty. This reflects how women are often judged or challenged not for their actions, but for simply being seen or perceived.

However, Psyche’s story begins to change when she loses Cupid and must face a difficult
journey alone. Venus gives her a set of impossible tasks: sorting seeds, gathering golden wool, and traveling to the underworld. These challenges mark a turning point. Psyche moves from being
passive to becoming someone who takes control of her own way. Her growth reflects the quiet
strength many women carry as they face personal or social challenges on their own. These trials also show Psyche’s intelligence and strength. She uses creative thinking, accepts help when needed, and stays patient and kind throughout. Nature and animals come to her side, recognizing the goodness in her heart. She proves that success can come not through power or force, but through grace, effort, and determination.



Psyche’s story still speaks to the lives of many women today. A real-life example is Mayor
Leni Robredo (City Mayor of Naga City and Former Vice President of Philippines). Despite facing criticism and gender-based challenges, she led both her city and country with honesty, care, and strength. Her leadership is proof that women can lead with vision and impact. Mayor Robredo,
like Psyche, represents how women can rise above expectations and make meaningful change. She shows that women are not just participants in society, but leaders and role models.

From a feminist criticism, Psyche begins as someone defined by others, but grows into a
person with her own voice and choices. Her story reminds us that love should be built on respect and growth, not on control or perfection. Genuine love and purity are the positive impact bring in the story that love requires sacrifice and need a lot of understanding.

Even today, women are still expected to be beautiful, obedient, and self-sacrificing in
relationships, like Psyche, through their own journeys that break these expectations, through
education, work, motherhood, or personal trials. The story becomes a symbol for every woman
through determination we are all equal and let remind ladies they have own fuel to flame the heart that will ignite their own light.

In the end, reading Cupid and Psyche through a feminist lens leaves us with an important
message, love and womanhood are not about submission, but about self-discovery. Psyche’s name means “soul” and her journey reminds us that real strength often comes from struggle. Even in ancient stories, women had the power to rise, to grow, and to shape their own paths. We may take this story a positive reminder to us that we human beings are all equal even from the different walks of life.

Queer Criticism
Iphis and Ianthe

A love story of Iphis and Ianthe shows how the story questions fixed ideas about gender.
Iphis is born a girl but lives as a boy, and everyone accepts this without knowing the truth. This
suggests that gender can be shaped by society rather than by the body alone. The love between Iphis and Ianthe shows that Same-sex attraction can exist even when a culture tries to ignore it. Their love for each other is the true meaning of genuine love. Despite their gender and
differences the relationship binds them to fight and continue the relationship even though society views it differently.

Queer criticism also pays close attention to the ending of the story. Iphis is changed into a
man so that the marriage can follow the rules of a heterosexual society and as same as the norm in real word, viewed as the marriage is the special union between man and women. This choice removes the same-sex attraction and replaces it with a form that feels safe to the culture in the tale. Because of this, the story shows both the power of sexual orientation and the strong pressure placed on it to disappear.
MORAL-PHILOSOPHICAL
The Gift of the Magi

The Gift of the Magi shows love and sacrifice that bring an important moral lesson to young
couples. Their love for each other pushes them to give up the important things they have just to
exchange gifts for Christmas, and this reflects the values and norms we see every holiday season.We prepare gifts for our loved ones and friends, and behind those gifts is the love and sacrificewe pour in just to bring them happiness and comfort. The story also reminds us of the sacrificeand journey of the three kings, who traveled far to give special gifts to our Lord Jesus Christ ashe was born for us, our Savior. The three kings share the same spirit as the young couple,showing a willingness to sacrifice what they have just to offer a special gift. The message of thestory seems to say that good intentions are enough, and that the Diwa ng Pasko is the specialbond we share with family and friends. Even without extravagant gifts or expensive things, the true gifts are love, understanding, and kindness to everyone.

Psychoanalytic 
Kulakog and Tilmag

In Kulakog and Tilmag, the characters actions seem to come from hidden fears and needs.
Kulakog acts only on what he feels at the moment, like sleeping, resting, and letting Tilmag do
most of the work. This shows the ID, the part of us that follows our wants without thinking of the
results. But when Tilmag falls, we see a different side of him. His fear and quick reaction show
that he is scared of losing her, even if he never says it. It's like the same when we feel the worth
of our loved ones when they are gone, that's the time we value the memories, happy moments,
and bonds we made, just like Kulakog, who only realized the value and importance of Tilmag.
Tilmag acts more like an ego because she tries to keep their daily life steady. She fetches fire,
cooks, and takes care of things even though it is dangerous and tiring. The people who watch
them, especially the fishermen, act like the superego because they judge their strange
relationship and talk about how they live. Kulakog also shows defense mechanisms. His laziness may be his way of avoiding responsibility, and his panic when Tilmag falls shows denial of how much she really means to him.

The places in the story also stand for their hidden feelings. The Mayon fire can represent strong
emotions that are powerful but risky. Tilmag falling into the forest shows how someone
important can be lost when we do not take enough care. The hill that grows where she fell feels
like a sign of Kulakog’s regret, something that stays even after many years. The Yawa River,
made by his frightened movement, shows how fear can create real and lasting damage. Their
relationship also hints at deeper issues, like dependence and the need for comfort. Kulakog is
huge, but he depends on a small woman to take care of him, which may point to feelings he
keeps inside. The way people talk about them shows the pressure of society on relationships. All together, the legend shows how hidden emotions, fears, and inner struggles can shape the lives of people, just like they shaped the land in the story. The story tells us that our courage and strong personality will help us to keep our journey, perseverance, and dedication in life, so that every step is even more meaningful.



 


3. Summary of Learning

Across the selection we studied, I learned that being human often means living with uncertainty, struggles, and the need for guidance. In Job 38 and Psalm 23, two different experiences of faith and life are presented. Job 38 reminds readers that there are limits to human understanding and that not everything can be explained. It highlights how small humans are in comparison to the vastness of creation. In contrast, Psalm 23 offers comfort and reassurance by portraying God as a shepherd who provides guidance and protection, especially during difficult moments. Together, these texts show that people experience both doubt and trust. Even when questions remain unanswered, individuals continue to search for peace, hope, and something to hold on to when life becomes overwhelming.
Stories from different cultures also reveal common struggles with identity and belonging. In the Panchatantra story of the lioness and the young jackal, the jackal’s suffering reflects the pain of trying to belong in a place where one is not fully accepted. This theme connects with Cupid and Psyche, where Psyche grows through trials and learns her own worth, particularly as a woman in a world that seeks to control her. Similarly, Iphis and Ianthe show that love can exist even when society does not approve, emphasizing that identity and emotions are more complex than social rules. These stories demonstrate that judgment, pressure, and rejection are shared human experiences, but personal growth often comes from self-acceptance.
Other texts focus on love, sacrifice, and inner emotions. The Gift of the Magi shows that genuine love is expressed through selfless sacrifice rather than material value. Kulakog and Tilmag highlight how unspoken feelings, fear, and regret can shape relationships and leave lasting effects. When read together, these texts suggest that mistakes, emotional struggles, and hardships are essential parts of being human, as they help individuals grow, love deeply, and search for acceptance and meaning in life.









4. Final Reflection

Before this course, my focus in literature was mostly on the plot or the moral lesson of a story, and I rarely considered its deeper meaning. Through this class, my understanding of literature has grown in ways I did not expect. Sir Irvin’s teaching emphasizes not only reading but also discussing different lenses and methods of interpretation. This approach helped me realize that literature is more than entertainment, as it reflects human experiences, society, and culture. I also learned that a single story can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the perspective applied.
The reading that challenged me the most was the collection of Panchatantra stories. At first, I found it difficult to take these stories seriously because they are fables that use animals as characters. As I read more closely, I realized that these animal characters reflect real human behavior and social realities. The stories present themes such as power, wisdom, betrayal, and survival, which closely mirror situations in real life. This experience challenged my initial assumptions and helped me understand that literature does not need to be realistic in form to express truth.
Reading the Great Books, including Job, Psalm 23, The Gift of the Magi, and the Panchatantra stories, further shaped my understanding of literature and values. These texts conveyed lessons on humility, faith, love, sacrifice, and self-knowledge while emphasizing the importance of understanding oneself and one’s place in the world. They showed that struggles, loss, and challenges are inherent in life and contribute to personal growth and empathy toward others. This course transformed the way I read, think, and reflect, making me more open-minded and appreciative of literature as a means to explore life, human experience, and moral values.
